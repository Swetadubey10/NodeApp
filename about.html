        Many note-taking applications force you to make lists, create pages and check off to-do lists. At NoteApp, we
        don't
        believe in forcing you to do anything. Your ideas are yours: Just get them out!
        <br><br>
        That's why we embraced the sticky note. There are no rules. Create, record, and organize with ease.
        <br><br>
        Your notes are stored on an infinitely-sized board and use your mind's <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spatial_memory" target="_blank">built-in spatial memory</a> for quick
        access
        and recall. You'll never lose your notes again because, just like driving around your hometown, "you've been
        there
        before."
